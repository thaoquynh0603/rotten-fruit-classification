<H2> Rotten Fruit Classification </H2>

Input: Images of three types of fruits (orange, banana, apple) in two status (fresh, rotten). 6 categories in total.

Task: From the provided image, classify what is the type of fruit and whether it's fresh.

Knowledge applied: Python, Tensorflow, Convolutional Neural Network, Transfer Learning (VGG16), Visualization, Model Evaluation

Outline:
1. Import and process the image
2. Build a basic convolutional neural network with 2 layers.
3. Transfer Learning with VGG16
4. Evaluation the model
5. Visualize the result
